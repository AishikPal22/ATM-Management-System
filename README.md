# Simple-Menu-Driven-ATM
This is a model ATM that replicates the real world ATMs to a certain extent while offering the user the independence to execute various ATM-related operations using any JAVA IDE, preferably IntelliJ IDEA.

Operations that can be performed using this program:
1. Create an account using an Account Number and Account PIN.
2. Deposit/Withdraw balance.
3. Balance transaction from savings account to checkings account and vice versa.
4. Check balance.

How to run the code:
1. If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, download the project and run the ATM class.
2. If you are using JVM:
   1. Download all 3 .java files from project_ATM\src directory and save them in a single folder.
   2. Open Command Prompt
   3. Go to project directory
   4. Run command: javac ATM.java
   5. After all 3 classes are created inside your folder, run command: java ATM
   6. The program is now up and running!
3. In case you are using other IDEs, indivually create the java classes by copying the corresponding source codes from project_ATM\src directory.
