# Simple-Menu-Driven-ATM
This is a model ATM that replicates the real world ATMs to a certain extent while offering the user the independence to execute various ATM-related operations using any JAVA IDE, preferably IntelliJ IDEA.

Operations that can be performed using this program:
1. Create an account using an Account Number and Account PIN.
2. Deposit/Withdraw balance.
3. Balance transaction from savings account to checkings account and vice versa.
4. Check balance.

How to run the code:
1. Download all 3 files and save them in a single folder.
2. If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, open the folder directory and run the ATM class.
3. If you are using JVM:
   1. Open Command Prompt
   2. Go to project directory
   3. Run command: javac ATM.java
   4. After all 3 classes are created inside your folder, run command: java ATM
   5. The program is now up and running!
4. In case you are using other IDEs, indivually create the java classes by copying the corresponding source codes.
